#class names should be uppercase for the first letter
#and uppercase, no spaces, for each word in the 
#class name. 
#when we make a class, we put it in its own file
#this makes life better!
#we also call the file name the same as the class name
#the class name follows normal rules for functions
#and for variable, i.e. no starting with a number,
#no spaces, etc.
