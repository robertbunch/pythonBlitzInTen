# Comments = are anything that is NOT for python
# Comments are for the devoloper/human

# variable assignment is var name on left, an =, value on right
name = "Rob" # assigning name to Rob
# Snake case is used in Python when you have a variable 
# name that has more than one word. The words are 
# separated by _
# camel case (alternative to snake) means starting each
# new word with a capital letter, except the first
#example: cookieCount
cookie_count = 12 # assigning cookie_count to 12
print("=========expecting 12=============")
print(cookie_count)
cookie_count = cookie_count - 2 #2 cookies were taken out
print("=========expecting 10=============")
print(cookie_count)
cookie_count = cookie_count + 10 #bake 10 new cookies
print("=========expecting 20=============")
print(cookie_count)

name = "Rob"
name = 'Rob'
# name = `Rob` Python will not like this!
